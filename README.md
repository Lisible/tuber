# tuber [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Lisible/tuber.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Lisible/tuber)
Tuber is a simple game engine written in Rust.  
It's primarily made for one of my other projects, **c√¶li**.

Its modular design is inspired by [Piston](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston)
